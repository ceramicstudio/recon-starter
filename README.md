# Running Recon Locally
This repository goes hand-in-hand with our YouTube video walk-through on how to run Ceramic Recon (Rust implementation) locally.

The major themes we will cover are:

1. Guided Ceramic node setup (using Ceramic-One, i.e. our Rust implementation)
2. ComposeDB data modeling directly relevant to fulfill the spec
3. Data interactions (querying, mutations, filtering)

## Getting Started

We will be using this repository for part of our workshop, so let's first clone the codebase so we don't have to worry about it later (you will need npm installed):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceramicstudio/software-trust-workshop && cd software-trust-workshop && npm install
```

You can open this repository in your code editor of choice for the second half of this workshop. This implementation mimics the Kubo RPC API and relies on https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic for the remaining logic.

## Node Setup
This workshop will use our [rust-ceramic](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic) implementation

You can find our external Rust-Ceramic instructions [here](https://threebox.notion.site/Ceramic-Recon-instructions-EXTERNAL-c2b93b2648d64cf0af0f4d2489d20399).

Assuming we will all be operating on macs, open a new terminal and:

1. Install nvm (if not already installed)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

2. Select node v20:

```bash
nvm install v20
nvm use 20
```

3. Install js-ceramic (with nighly builds):

```bash
npm install --location=global @ceramicnetwork/cli@nightly
```

4. Download Rust-Ceramic from binary distribution:

#### MacOS

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/releases/download/v0.13.0/ceramic-one_aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar zxvf ceramic-one_aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
```

Open Finder, double click the `ceramic-one.pkg` file to start the install

 After installation, copy the binary:

```bash
sudo cp /Applications/ceramic-one /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Linux

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/rust-ceramic/releases/download/v0.13.0/ceramic-one_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar zxvf ceramic-one_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
dpkg -i ceramic-one.deb
```

5. Start rust-ceramic (must be started first as js-ceramic needs the endpoint on startup):

```bash
ceramic-one daemon
```

6. In a new terminal, start js-ceramic with `CERAMIC_RECON_MODE` enabled and pointing to the rust-ceramic instance:

```bash
nvm use 20
CERAMIC_RECON_MODE="true" ceramic daemon --ipfs-api http://localhost:5001
```

We now have our Ceramic node running on port 7007. In the following steps, we will deploy our composite onto our node.

**Troubleshooting** 

If you received error messages, please first ensure that you're running node v20 in the terminals you're running the above commands in. Next, if you've previously ran Ceramic locally, the legacy data from those sessions might also be causing issues. Go into `~/.ceramic` from your machine's root directory (if exists) and delete the `statestore` subdirectory and the `indexing.sqlite` file before trying the commands again.

### Configure Your Admin DID

Back in your code editor's terminal (or a terminal opened to the `software-trust-workshop` directory), configure an admin DID our node will use in order to deploy our composites:

```bash
nvm use 20
npm install -g @composedb/cli
```

```bash
composedb did:generate-private-key
```

This will print out a unique and random private key. We need to get the public key associated with this private key.

Store the private in an environment variable.

```bash
read -s DID_PRIVATE_KEY #paste in the key from the previous command and hit enter
export DID_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Now generate the corresponding public key from the private key:

```bash
composedb did:from-private-key
```

On your machine, go into the following file off your machine's root: `~/.ceramic/daemon.config.json`. In your daemon.config.json file, add the did you just added into the `admin-dids` array. It should look something like this:

```json
{
  "anchor": {},
  "http-api": {
    "cors-allowed-origins": [
      ".*"
    ],
    "admin-dids": ["did:key:<your new public key>"]
  },
  "ipfs": {
    "mode": "bundled"
  },
  "logger": {
    "log-level": 2,
    "log-to-files": false
  },
  "network": {
    "name": "testnet-clay"
  },
  "node": {},
  "state-store": {
    "mode": "fs",
    "local-directory": "/Users/<you>/.ceramic/statestore"
  },
  "indexing": {
    "db": "sqlite:///Users/<you>/.ceramic/indexing.sqlite",
    "allow-queries-before-historical-sync": true,
    "models": []
  }
}
```

Restart the js-ceramic process for the new config to take effect - go back to the original two terminals you began with, cancel the processes that are running, and re-run steps 6 above (which restarts the js-ceramic process - you can keep the rust-ceramic process running).

### Deploy the Models

Back in the root directory of this repository you should now be able to deploy the existing composite we previously created previously by running:

```bash
composedb composite:deploy ./src/__generated__/definition.json
```

### User-to-User Signals

```json

      "reason": ["Software engineer", "Ethereum core developer"]
    },

"credentialSchema": [{
  "id": "ipfs://QmcwYEnLysTyepjjtJw19oTDwuiopbCDbEcCuprCBiL7gl",
  "type": "JsonSchema"
},
"proof": {}
```

The data model above is in JWT verifiable credential format. Here's how we are thinking about how this translates to ComposeDB:


```GraphQL
################## Account Trust Credentials
type AccountTrustSignal
  @createModel(accountRelation: SET, accountRelationFields: ["recipient"], description: "An account trust signal")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "recipient" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuanceDate" }]) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  recipient: DID! @accountReference
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  trustWorthiness: [AccountTrustTypes!]! @list(maxLength: 1000)
  proof: String! @string(maxLength: 10000)
}

type AccountTrustTypes {
  scope: String! @string(maxLength: 1000)
  level: Float! 
  reason: [String] @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 100)
}
```

**Use of SET**

In ComposeDB, you can define relations between a schema model instance and the Ceramic account that controls that instance in 3 ways - SINGLE, LIST, AND SET. SINGLE requires there only ever be 1 model instance for that schema per account. LIST allows there to be an unlimited number of instances associated with that account. Conversely, SET allows developers to enforce a unique list of instances associated with an account based on a certain subfield (or set of subfields).

In the schema above, by indicating SET with the `accountRelationFields` array set to "recipient", we are ensuring that user A can only create 1 instance that points to user B.

For more information, read our [SET RFC](https://forum.ceramic.network/t/rfc-native-support-for-unique-list-relationships-between-stream-types-and-accounts/1406).

**Use of @createIndex**

The @createIndex directive instructs your ComposeDB node to build an index on the defined field, allowing developers to perform filters and ordering based on those indexes. Note that this does NOT work for embedded objects or enums.

**Issuer**

Any field definition marked as `DID! @documentAccount` will be automatically filled based on the authenticated account creating or updating a model instance (meaning it does not need to be manually inputted).

**Proof**

The plaintext fields in the `AccountTrustSignal` model provides all the information we need to read from directly. However, we've left in the "proof" field to accommodate any portable verified data object - for example, a stringified VC signed by the authenticated user.

### User-to-Software Audit Signals

Original JSON representation example:

```json
"id": "ipfs://QmPTqvH3vm6qcZSGqAUsq78MQa9Ctb56afRZg1WJ5sKLiu",
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "SecurityReportCredential"],
"issuanceDate": "2024-02-15T07:05:56.273Z",
"issuer": "did:pkh:eth:0x44dc4E3309B80eF7aBf41C7D0a68F0337a88F044",
"credentialSubject":
{
  "id": "snap://CLwZocaUEbDErtQAsybaudZDJq65a8AwlEFgkGUpmAQ=",
  "securityStatus": "Unsecured",
  "securityFindings": [
    {
      "criticality": 1,
      "type": "Key leak",
      "description": "`snap_getBip44Entropy` makes the parent key accessible"
      "lang": "en"
    },
    {
      "criticality": 0.5,
      "type": "Buffer Overflow"
    },
    {
      "criticality": 0.25,
      "type": "Phishing"
    },
    {
      "criticality": 0,
      "type": "Data leak",
      "description": "API can communicate data to a centralized server"
    },
  ]
},
"proof": {}
```

ComposeDB interpretation:

```GraphQL
type SecurityAudit
  @createModel(accountRelation: SET, accountRelationFields: ["subjectId"], description: "A security audit")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "subjectId" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "issuanceDate" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "securityStatus" }]) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  subjectId: String! @string(maxLength: 1000)
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  securityStatus: Boolean!
  securityFindings: [Findings!]! @list(maxLength: 1000)
  proof: String! @immutable @string(maxLength: 10000)
  reviews: [AuditReview] @relationFrom(model: "AuditReview", property: "auditId")
}

type Findings {
  criticality: Float! 
  type: String! @string(maxLength: 1000)
  description: String @string(maxLength: 1000)
  lang: String! @string(maxLength: 2)
}
```

**Use of SET**

It's highly relevant here for us to limit 1 security audit an account can issue against any 1 software verion. In this case, we've represented the identifier for a snap as `subjectId` (for example, "snap://CLwZocaUEbDErtQAsybaudZDJq65a8AwlEFgkGUpmAQ=").

**Use of @immutable**

Since our system will allow users to generate reviews of audits, we want to ensure that the values of those audits don't change over time (thus nullifying reviews that point to those audits). It's unreasonable to expect users to constantly keep watch across audits they've left reviews for to ensure they don't change over time, so we want some assurances that they won't change.

In this case, since we're assuming that the `proof` subfield would contain a stringified signed object (like a VC), we've identified this field as immutable, which means it cannot change after it's been initially set. Given that there's a "!" following the scalar type (String), GraphQL will not allow any model instance creation query to go through without this field filled in.

This implementation would require some client-side work to verify that the VC matches the values in the ComposeDB fields. Another solution could enforce locking of the entire document, if desired.

**Relation to AuditReview**

In the next section we will observe the `AuditReview` schema definition (which can only ever be created in relation to a specific `SecurityAudit` instance). This means that developers will be able to query based on the relationship between an `AuditReview` and the `SecurityAudit` it references, in addition to the opposite direction (`AuditReviews` associated with a specific `SecurityAudit`).

### User-to-Audit Review Signals

Original JSON representation example:

```json
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ReviewCredential"],
"issuanceDate": "2024-02-15T07:05:56.273Z",
"issuer": "did:pkh:eth:0x44dc4E3309B80eF7aBf41C7D0a68F0337a88F044",
"credentialSubject":
{
  "id": "ipfs://QmPTqvH3vm6qcZSGqAUsq78MQa9Ctb56afRZg1WJ5sKLiu",
  "currentStatus": "Disputed",
  "reason": ["Missed Vulnerability"],
},
"proof": {}
```

ComposeDB interpretation:

```GraphQL
type AuditReview
  @createModel(accountRelation: SET, accountRelationFields: ["auditId"], description: "An audit review")
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "auditId" }])
  @createIndex(fields: [{ path: "endorsedStatus" }]) {
  issuer: DID! @documentAccount
  issuanceDate: DateTime!
  auditId: StreamID! @documentReference(model: "SecurityAudit")
  audit: SecurityAudit! @relationDocument(property: "auditId")
  endorsedStatus: Boolean!
  reason: [String!]! @string(maxLength: 1000) @list(maxLength: 1000)
  proof: String! @immutable @string(maxLength: 10000)
}
```

**Use of SET**

We want to make sure an account can only ever create 1 review per specific audit.

**Relation Back to SecurityAudit**

We've defined a relationship between the `AuditReview` and `SecurityAudit` schemas such that the `auditId` subfield must intake a Stream ID scalar that is a model instance document of a `SecurityAudit`. The `audit` subfield below it exposes that node for querying based on an `AuditReview` as the entrypoint. This is also what allows us to expose querying to all `AuditReview` instances from within a `SecurityAudit`.

## Running Queries in the Application UI

We've set up this repository so you can run some queries to an existing production node that's indexing the models found in `/composites`, as well as running queries to your local node running on localhost:7007 (which you'll be able to toggle manually).

From the root of this repository (`/software-trust-system`) start your application in developer mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser to http://localhost:3000/.

Under the "ComposeDB Endpoint" you will see that an external cloud node endpoint has already been provided to you. Go ahead and fill in the fields below. Once you've added at least 1 trustworthiness item, you should be able to issue a credential.

Go ahead and issue a credential with the default node endpoint given to you. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/reads` where we can verify that it synced to our node. With your local node still running, replace the value under the "ComposeDB Endpoint" text with `http://localhost:7007`. Next, if you run the default query within the `GetAccountTrustSignals` tab, you should be able to see the document you just created within the set of returned documents.

Finally, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/mutations` to explore additional pre-made queries we've constructed across the other schemas.
